# Contact Management System

### This project is made using (MERN stack) MongoDB, ExpressJs, ReactJS & NodeJS.

### Features-
Different user can create their account and add their contact list. &&
The contact list will shown according to the user logged in. &&
There is email validation added so that the user can input the right email only.
There is a search functionality through which users can search for the contacts of a specific person.
User can do CRUD operations on their contact- Create a contact, edit the contact, filter the contact, and delete the contact.
Users can download all the contacts into to Excel sheet.
I have added JsonWebToken in the app so that users can't get logged out on every operation.
